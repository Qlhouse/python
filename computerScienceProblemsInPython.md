# Fibonacci sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers such that any number, except for the first and second, is the sum of the previous two:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 . . .

> The reason for the infinite recursion is that we never specified a base case.     



**Memoization** is a technique in which you store the result of computational tasks when they are completed so that when you need them again, you can look them up instead of compute them a second time.
